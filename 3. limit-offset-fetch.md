## LIMIT OFFSET & FETCH

### LIMIT
The ```LIMIT``` keyword is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT 5;
```
This command will return the first 5 rows in the table.
### Example

This command will return the first n rows in the table, starting from the mth row.

### OFFSET
The ```OFFSET``` keyword is used to skip a certain number of rows before returning the desired output.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
OFFSET 5;
```
This command will skip the first 5 rows in the table and display the remaining rows.

### Example 
```sql
SELECT * FROM table LIMIT n OFFSET m;
```

This command will return the first n rows in the table, starting from the mth row.

### FETCH

The ```FETCH``` keyword is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY;
```
This command will return the first n rows in the table.

### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM cars
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
```
This command will return the first 5 rows in the table.

To combine all the commands above, you can use the ```LIMIT``` keyword to limit the number of rows returned by a query, followed by the ```OFFSET``` keyword to skip a certain number of rows before returning the desired output.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT n OFFSET m;
```
This command will return the first n rows in the table, starting from the mth row.

### Example
```sql
SELECT * FROM cars
LIMIT 5 FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY OFFSET 10;
```
This command will return the first 5 rows in the table, starting from the 11th row.
