## Group By Keyword

The ```GROUP BY ``` keyword is used to group rows in a table based on one or more columns.

You can add the aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX) to the ```GROUP BY``` keyword to group the data by one or more columns.

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```

### Example

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```

This command will return the number of rows in the table, grouped by the column_name column.
